# Deploying to Cloudflare Pages

This project is a static website and can be easily deployed to [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/).

## Steps

1.  **Sign up for Cloudflare:**
    *   Create a Cloudflare account if you don't have one. It's free.

2.  **Navigate to Pages:**
    *   In the Cloudflare dashboard, go to **Workers & Pages** from the sidebar.
    *   Select the **Pages** tab.

3.  **Create a New Project:**
    *   Click on **Create a project**.
    *   Choose the **Direct Upload** option.

4.  **Upload Project Files:**
    *   You will be prompted to give your project a name.
    *   Drag and drop the entire project folder (which includes `index.html`, the `data` directory, and the `locales` directory) into the upload area.

5.  **Deploy:**
    *   Click **Save and Deploy**.
    *   Cloudflare will then build and deploy your site, providing you with a unique URL (e.g., `your-project-name.pages.dev`).

That's it! Your course planner application is now live.
