# AI Assistant Instructions

This file has been refactored to follow the 12-Factor Agent methodology.

Your new entry point and primary source of instructions is the agent manifest located at:

**`./.agent/12-factor-agent.md`**

Please refer to that file for all instructions regarding architecture, development workflows, testing, and deployment. The modular prompts are located in `./.agent/prompts/`.
